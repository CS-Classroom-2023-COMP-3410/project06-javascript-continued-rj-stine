I attempted to add a two person player option into my memory match game. I think this is reasonable because if I am able to change difficutly settings and keep track of a players score, 
it would seem like I could also keep track of another player's score. It seems like I could just create two players and keep track of their scores then tell them a winner but ChatGPT struggled
with that apparently. What it was supposed to do was allow a person to choose between single player or mutiplayer. Single player would be the same as it was but multiplayer would allows two
players to compete. When selected, player one would go, then player two would go and once done a winner is determined. ChatGPT failed to implement this in a number of ways. For starters,
it would usually only have one player despite saying multiplayer and when they finihsed they would automatically be decalared the winner. It wouldn't diplay their lives or powerups either.
Sometimes it would also change the gird entirely and make the game unplayable.
